Please first use our online patching page to install: https://smash64.online/remix

If that causes issues, follow the instructions below:

1. Download and unzip the Smash Remix release file
2. Take your legally acquired ROM and drag it onto the appropriate icon for your operating system
3. Example: Windows users, drag your ROM onto windows-drag-here (or windows-drag-here.bat)
4. Read any dialog windows that pop-up
5. Find your patched ROMs in the output directory

Special note for OSX users:

- Apple has stronger restrictions on running unsigned apps from the Internet. You must perform an extra step before you can drag your ROM onto osx-drag-here. You can see more information here. I recommend the following
